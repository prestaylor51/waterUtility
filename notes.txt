	Technicians use laptops to gather data
		maybe I should look into importing directly from excel to DB\
	RESTful API can be made using a number of web stacks
	No web stack is nessesarily the best 
	I Im going to save the manufacturer pump curves as blobs
		they are small and it will prevent me from having to 
		imoplement a file system
	Do I need to implememnt a file system?
	
	I'm thinking that we might be able to forget the browser and use excell
	insert into the database and to query aswell. As long as VBA supports 
	RESTful ASI call then Excell could be the only interface we need.
